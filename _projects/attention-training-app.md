## Key Features

- **Scientifically-validated exercises** based on cognitive psychology research
- **Gamification elements** to maintain user engagement
- **Progress tracking** and performance analytics
- **Adaptive difficulty** that adjusts to user performance

## Technical Implementation

The app was built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility, with a Node.js backend and MongoDB for data storage. Machine learning algorithms powered by TensorFlow provide personalized training recommendations.

## Research Foundation

Based on established cognitive training paradigms including:
- Attention Network Test (ANT)
- Dual N-Back tasks
- Stroop task variations
